Pipedrive is a great tool but it's missing some pretty simple but super useful features. In this post, I'd like to explain how we implemented an automated calculated field using the Pipedrive API.

## The process in a nutshell

Pipedrive, as well as other similar tools, offer both webhooks and a well documented API. The [webhook](/using-webhooks-to-add-functionality-to-your-business-tools/) can inform us when data changes in Pipedrive. The [Pipedrive API](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/) let's us update our deals or contacts in the tool dynamically.

IN PROGRESS
