#Ben Kammerling's Jekyll Test Site

Ben liked the idea of static web site generation and wanted to give it a try himself. Try he did and success came shortly after. What once looked laborious and intimidating became a walk in the park, birds singing sweet melodies, dogs excitedly sniffing out each other in and around plants and trees. 

This is the basic site using the default theme minima. Docs can all be found on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/)
